As far as I know, Adventureland is free to copy and distribute. Neither the
source nor the scarce documentation provided from PC-SIG states a copyright
or mentions a fee to be paid. Under any circumstance, the means of
distribution implies that one cannot distribute Adventureland for profit.

If you want to distribute a reprogrammed or changed source, you must include
the original source and documentation as distributed in this archive and
document any changes made.
